The <strong>Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI)</strong> is a gathering for scholars of <em>human-drone interaction (HDI)</em> and related subjects, co-located with the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/">2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human-drone interaction (HDI)</strong> is becoming an ubiquitous topic in daily life, and a rising research topic within CHI. Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform the design and scholarship of HDI, and interdisciplinary communication -- between design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities -- is essential to this end. The <strong>Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI)</strong> aims to bring together diverse perspectives; advancing HDI and its scholarship through a rich variety of participants and hands-on activities where an assortment of research, design, and prototyping methods are deployed. The workshop intends to serve as a platform for a diverse and enduring community that continuously builds on each other's methods and philosophies, towards results that <em>take off</em>.

<p>
Drones are becoming ubiquitous. Current applications include logistics, construction, security, emergencies, and photography. Emerging applications such as exercise, companionship, and tangible user interfaces are active research topics within the CHI community.
</p>
				
<p>
Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform new drone applications; and communication between different disciplines &ndash; design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities &ndash; is essential. To this end, the <strong>Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI)</strong> aims to intertwine diverse perspectives, as a platform for researchers and practitioners learning from each other.
</p>

</div>
<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
	
<p>
We seek high quality contributions exploring HDI from a plethora of perspectives, including but not limited to: empirical research, engineering, design, theory, art, and opinions. Examples for topics can include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Novel HDI experiences</li>
<li>Theoretical and philosophical arguments on concepts and contexts</li>
<li>Transferring learnings between HDI and other HCI or extracurricular topics</li>
<li>Policy and regulatory issues</li>
<li>Accessible HDI</li>
<li>Prototyping and development tools</li>
<li>Ethnographic fieldwork with users, developers, and bystanders</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit 2- to 6-page position papers in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format, on or before February 11, 2020; at: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihdi2020">easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihdi2020</a>
</p>

<p>
The proceedings will be stored on the open archive <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/">HAL</a>, indexed by Google Scholar. A paper on workshop outcomes will be submitted to a relevant venue. Selected contributions will be invited for publication in a special issue of the THRI journal.
</p>

<p>
At least one author must attend. Attendees must register for the workshop and at least one day of CHI 2020.
