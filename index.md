<p>
The <strong>Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI)</strong> is a gathering for scholars of <em>human-drone interaction (HDI)</em> and related subjects, co-located with the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/">2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
Human-drone interaction (HDI) is becoming an ubiquitous topic in daily life, and a rising research topic within CHI. Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform the design and scholarship of HDI, and interdisciplinary communication -- between design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities -- is essential to this end. The Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI) aims to bring together diverse perspectives; advancing HDI and its scholarship through a rich variety of participants and hands-on activities where an assortment of research, design, and prototyping methods are deployed. The workshop intends to serve as a platform for a diverse community that continuously builds on each other's methods and philosophies, towards results that <em>take off</em>.
</p>
<p>
Current HDI research field builds on a diverse motivations and methodologies, with contributions originating from various clusters worldwide. As HDI researchers in the CHI community, we observe significant potentials for expediting and compounding research efforts where different research efforts intersect. Thus we aim to hold an <em>interdisciplinary</em> and hands-on HDI workshop with participants from an expansive variety of disciplines, including engineering, design, and humanities. Our goal is to build an enduring community of researchers who continue to learn from each other's methods and philosophies, continuing with impactful research contributions over the long term.

<p>
Drones are becoming ubiquitous. Current applications include logistics, construction, security, emergencies, and photography. Emerging applications such as exercise, companionship, and tangible user interfaces are active research topics within the CHI community.
</p>
				
<p>
Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform new drone applications; and communication between different disciplines &ndash; design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities &ndash; is essential. To this end, the <strong>Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI)</strong> aims to intertwine diverse perspectives, as a platform for researchers and practitioners learning from each other.
</p>

<p>
We seek high quality contributions exploring HDI from a plethora of perspectives, including but not limited to: empirical research, engineering, design, theory, art, and opinions. Examples for topics can include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Novel HDI experiences</li>
<li>Theoretical and philosophical arguments on concepts and contexts</li>
<li>Transferring learnings between HDI and other HCI or extracurricular topics</li>
<li>Policy and regulatory issues</li>
<li>Accessible HDI</li>
<li>Prototyping and development tools</li>
<li>Ethnographic fieldwork with users, developers, and bystanders</li>
</ul>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit 2- to 6-page position papers in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format, on or before February 11, 2020; at: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihdi2020">easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihdi2020</a>
</p>

<p>
The proceedings will be stored on the open archive <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/">HAL</a>, indexed by Google Scholar. A paper on workshop outcomes will be submitted to a relevant venue. Selected contributions will be invited for publication in a special issue of the THRI journal.
</p>

<p>
At least one author must attend. Attendees must register for the workshop and at least one day of CHI 2020.

<p>**Mehmet Aydın Baytaş** completed his PhD within Koç University's interdisciplinary Design, Technology and Society program. He is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellow at Qualisys AB, and a research affiliate at Chalmers University of Technology's t2i Lab. His current research, supported by [the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program -- Humanities and Society (WASP-HS)](https://wasp-hs.org/projects/the-rise-of-social-drones-a-constructive-design-research-agenda/) addresses the design space of autonomous drones operating in human-populated environments.</p>

<p>**Markus Funk** is a senior user experience researcher at Cerence. Inc, Germany. Markus is an expert in human-drone interaction and flying user interfaces.</p>

<p>**Sara Ljungblad** is an Assistant Professor at the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. She is interested in inclusive design methods and has done several long-term studies understand experiences of robotic products in everyday settings. She is currently funded by [WASP-HS](https://wasp-hs.org/projects/the-rise-of-social-drones-a-constructive-design-research-agenda/) to conduct constructive and critical design research on "social drones."</p>

<p>**Jérémie Garcia** is an Assistant Professor at ENAC, Toulouse, France. He is interested in designing interactions to author and operate automated systems including drones and air traffic control.</p>
